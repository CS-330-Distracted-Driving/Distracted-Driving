/*TODO:

> set listeners to respond to pressing login button or to return key being pressed while password/username field is highlighted
> write a function to respond to login button / return key while username/password field highlighted with checking the users dictionary 
for username, retrieving password from corresponding struct if username in dictionary, comparing password, and if the
password matches then it should call the login function from userdata.js and send the user to the landing 
page via a document.location.href = newUrl call.
> if username not in dict or password doesnt match, respond by displaying some message explaining that 
username + password combo not found.
